so I've been reading xkcd recently, starting from the beginning. Well more
accurately I started from the beginning of the comics and am working forwards,
but started from the end of the whatif's and went backwards. Turns out I liked
the what ifs ALOT and I kinda just read them all last weekend. Worth. Anyways
thought I might link some old xkcd posts that I liked that most people who
havn't seen will never see because, well, they're old.

theres more but I got bored of writting this blogity blog. This would be more
fun if I was writing the webpages in htML and not some random markdown
