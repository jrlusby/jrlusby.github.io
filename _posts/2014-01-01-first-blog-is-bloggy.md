I decided to make a blog today and had no idea what to write about. I found myself wondering, what does blog even mean? Blinternet log? Binternet Log? Blinternet Og? Best I came up with after a massive five minutes of thought was Binary Log.

> Turns out it means weB Log

Who the decided it was a good idea to use the last letter of web??

I guess it works better than wlog.. but still, come up with something believable, like Binary log. Thats definitly much cooler than weB log
